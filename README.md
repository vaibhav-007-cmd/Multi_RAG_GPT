# Multi_RAG_GPT
In the vast expanse of human knowledge, spanning over 150 years of self-development, philosophy, and psychology, lies a treasure trove of wisdom. This project, Multi_RAG_GPT, is designed to tap into this rich reservoir, reading through books, videos, and seminar materials to provide personalized answers that inspire and uplift individuals, teams, and organizations.

Our aim is to help you navigate through stress, enhance your mental well-being, and ignite your motivation to achieve greater goals. While we utilize standard and professional materials, remember that if you are experiencing stress, depression, or any other issues, it is crucial to seek professional advice. Be open, and never hesitate to ask for help.
